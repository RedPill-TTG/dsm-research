# Tools

A collection of useful tools while tinkering with the DSM:

1. [`syno-pwd`](syno-pwd.php): a simple PHP script generating daily password to access DSM which wasn't installed yet
2. [`redpill-lkm`](https://github.com/RedPill-TTG/redpill-lkm) (separate repo): open-source kernel module allowing DSM
   to load on non-DSM hardware for a more convenient research
3. [`patch-ramdisk-check`](patch-ramdisk-check.php): a tool to patch vmlinux to disable ramdisk check
