# DSM Research

This repository contains a loosely-organized information regarding the processes of DSM loading. A lot of information 
present here was collected by reverse-engineering Jun's loader (more on that later) as well as reading through
[Synology's GPL resources](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/files/Synology%20NAS%20GPL%20Source/).

## Target audience
This repository is targeted towards developers willing to understand the DSM platform better. All information contained
here are presented **for educational purposes only** and [licensed under GPLv3](LICENSE) (unless noted otherwise).
